# VivaTerminalRelayServer
Design and concept for the VivaWallet Relay Server

### IM30 PAX Terminal

If a IM30 PAX Terminal is used on another network then the platform or product you use, the IM30 is not usable. However using a Relay Server can solve this issue and can send transaction to 1 or more terminals.

Custom API connector(s) can be created and added to the Relay Server to receive the payment request(s).

The Relay server can be installed on a local computer and can be used on Linux, Apple, Windows etc... IOT devices like OrangePI, Raspberry PI, etc...

A webhook wil be used to receive the payment is succesfull.
